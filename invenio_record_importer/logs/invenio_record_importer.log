A. Horodecky\'s book (1923), in which he claimed that Hasidism brought about full equality of Jewish men and women in the field of spirituality. Although his claims have been by and large rejected, most\nscholars agree that the twentieth century Chabad movement has indeed created space for women in the hasidic model of spirituality. This article sets out to explore whether the particular interest of contemporary Chabad in the role of women is a new phenomenon or has existed from the movement\'s inception. Rather than looking at the issue from a social-historical perspective, the article examines the gender discourse conveyed in the homilies of the founder of Chabad, Rabbi Shneur Zalman of Liadi (1745–1812). It explores the role of the feminine aspect of divinity in the process of creation, and its envisioned elevation in the future-to-come, in an attempt to establish the relation between the gender category of "female" and flesh-and-blood women in the teachings of Shneur Zalman of Liadi. This, in turn, leads to determine whether the concept of the transfigurations of genders in the future-to-come, a Chabad tradition that originates in the teachings of Shneur Zalman of Liadi and serves as the ideological ground for the empowerment of Chabad women in the writings of the late Lubavitcher Rebbe in the twentieth century, could have any relevance to the daily life of wives and daughters of Shneur Zalman\'s followers.', 'identifiers': [{'scheme': 'hclegacy-pid', 'identifier': 'hc:22625'}, {'scheme': 'hclegacy-record-id', 'identifier': '1000361-383'}, {'scheme': 'datacite-doi', 'identifier': '10.17613/hrhn-3k43'}, {'scheme': 'url', 'identifier': 'https://doi.org/10.17613/hrhn-3k43'}], 'contributors': [{'role': {'id': 'other', 'title': {'de': 'Andere', 'en': 'Other'}, '@v': '4e24fe5d-64e2-4236-b69d-5d01c68f291f::1'}, 'person_or_org': {'name': 'Sagiv, Gadi', 'type': 'personal', 'given_name': 'Gadi', 'family_name': 'Sagiv'}}, {'role': {'id': 'other', 'title': {'de': 'Andere', 'en': 'Other'}, '@v': '4e24fe5d-64e2-4236-b69d-5d01c68f291f::1'}, 'person_or_org': {'name': 'Meir, Jonatan', 'type': 'personal', 'given_name': 'Jonatan', 'family_name': 'Meir'}}], 'resource_type': {'id': 'textDocument-bookSection', 'title': {'de': 'Buchabteilung', 'en': 'Book section'}, 'props': {'type': 'textDocument', 'subtype': 'textDocument-bookSection'}, '@v': 'f838ec10-3bad-470f-9f17-3b91214a7dd4::1'}, 'publication_date': '2016'}, 'custom_fields': {'imprint:imprint': {'pages': '57-74', 'title': 'Habad Hasidism: History, Thought, Image'}, 'hclegacy:file_pid': 'hc:22626', 'kcr:commons_domain': 'ajs.hcommons.org', 'hclegacy:collection': 'hccollection:1', 'kcr:submitter_email': 'wojciech.tworek.09@ucl.ac.uk', 'hclegacy:submitter_id': '1017065', 'kcr:user_defined_tags': ['Hasidism', 'Chabad', 'Jewish studies', 'Jewish mysticism', 'Jewish thought'], 'hclegacy:file_location': '/srv/www/commons/current/web/app/uploads/humcore/2019/01/o_1d2bs18df1fnlt451861gk91rer7.pdf.55710426.pdf', 'kcr:submitter_username': 'wtworek', 'hclegacy:groups_for_deposit': [{'group_name': 'Jewish Mysticism', 'group_identifier': '1000610'}, {'group_name': 'Modern Jewish Thought and Theology', 'group_identifier': '1000611'}], 'hclegacy:record_change_date': '2019-01-29T03:57:00Z', 'hclegacy:previously_published': 'published', 'hclegacy:record_creation_date': '2019-01-29T03:57:00Z', 'hclegacy:submitter_affiliation': 'University Of Toronto', 'hclegacy:submitter_org_memberships': ['ajs', 'hc']}}

The reinterpretation of the precept of setting times for Torah study in Rashaz's writings was one of the factors that greatly contributed to the re-evaluation of the role of ordinary people in religious life, and to shaping Ḥabad's inclusivist vision of mysticism.", 'identifiers': [{'scheme': 'hclegacy-pid', 'identifier': 'hc:22623'}, {'scheme': 'hclegacy-record-id', 'identifier': '1000361-381'}, {'scheme': 'datacite-doi', 'identifier': '10.17613/9w0d-5f24'}, {'scheme': 'doi', 'identifier': '10.1017/S0364009414000026'}, {'scheme': 'url', 'identifier': 'https://doi.org/10.17613/9w0d-5f24'}, {'scheme': 'issn', 'identifier': '1475-4541'}], 'resource_type': {'id': 'textDocument-journalArticle', 'title': {'de': 'Zeitschriftenartikel', 'en': 'Journal article'}, 'props': {'type': 'textDocument', 'subtype': 'textDocument-journalArticle'}, '@v': '70443db0-d1c1-4a26-9f9c-573a9c8ae4a8::1'}, 'publication_date': '2014'}, 'custom_fields': {'journal:journal': {'issn': '0364-0094', 'issue': '01', 'pages': '29-57', 'title': 'AJS Review', 'volume': '38'}, 'hclegacy:file_pid': 'hc:22624', 'kcr:commons_domain': 'ajs.hcommons.org', 'hclegacy:collection': 'hccollection:1', 'kcr:submitter_email': 'wojciech.tworek.09@ucl.ac.uk', 'hclegacy:submitter_id': '1017065', 'kcr:user_defined_tags': ['Hasidism', 'Chabad', 'Shneur Zalman', 'Torah', 'Jewish studies', 'Jewish thought', 'Jewish mysticism', 'Jewish history'], 'hclegacy:file_location': '/srv/www/commons/current/web/app/uploads/humcore/2019/01/o_1d2brh3n44112jlcvm5rf17iv7.pdf.setting_times_for_torah_study_in_r._shne.pdf', 'kcr:submitter_username': 'wtworek', 'hclegacy:record_change_date': '2019-01-29T03:48:10Z', 'hclegacy:previously_published': 'published', 'hclegacy:record_creation_date': '2019-01-29T03:48:10Z', 'hclegacy:submitter_affiliation': 'University Of Toronto', 'hclegacy:submitter_org_memberships': ['ajs', 'hc']}}

It fits the tone of other PBS documentaries: both informational and relaxing. In the canon of artist documentaries, it is similar but more professionally focused than the 2021 Rita Moreno episode of American Masters. It may be most similar to the 1993 The South Bank Show episode on Annie Liebovitz: structured by significant projects, showcasing famous works, and supplemented by personal interviews.", 'identifiers': [{'scheme': 'hclegacy-pid', 'identifier': 'hc:45657'}, {'scheme': 'hclegacy-record-id', 'identifier': '1001634-274'}, {'scheme': 'datacite-doi', 'identifier': '10.17613/kny1-0b95'}, {'scheme': 'url', 'identifier': 'https://multimediatechnologyreviews.arlisna.hcommons.org/2022/02/20/pedro-e-guerrero-a-photographers-journey/'}], 'resource_type': {'id': 'textDocument-review', 'title': {'de': 'Rezension', 'en': 'Review'}, 'props': {'type': 'textDocument', 'subtype': 'textDocument-review'}, '@v': 'a4184365-03ae-4d37-9220-7187034622c5::1'}, 'publication_date': '2022'}, 'custom_fields': {'journal:journal': {'title': 'Multimedia & Technology Reviews'}, 'hclegacy:file_pid': 'hc:45658', 'kcr:commons_domain': 'arlisna.hcommons.org', 'hclegacy:collection': 'hccollection:1', 'kcr:submitter_email': 'aprovo@gmail.com', 'hclegacy:submitter_id': '1006873', 'kcr:user_defined_tags': ['2022 February', 'documentary films', 'latinx artists', 'Pedro E.

Vostell's Concrete Book is a concrete slab in the shape of a book, measuring 34x25x4.5 cm, weighing about 9 kg (20 pounds) that is believed to encapsulate a copy of the author's paper-based booklet Betonierungen (Concretifications) which comprises unbound reproductions of many of his concrete works and utopian proposals to 'concretify' cities, furniture, and even clouds. In 1971, the artist constructed one hundred copies of the Concrete Book, and the copy no83 is in the holdings of the University of Chicago Library collection of rare artists' books. An unreadable book in any conventional sense, Concrete Book foregrounds tactility, physicality and materiality, providing a unique opportunity to explore questions of making and meaning: why the materials of bookmaking matter and how they signify. We assume that there is truly a book inside, but how can we confirm its presence? What non-destructive tests could be used to examine the inner contents? \n\nThis paper presents the results of an interdisciplinary study of Vostell's book that brings together curatorial, conservation and material science expertise and discusses how new material knowledge can enrich our understanding of an object's biography. Employing Vostell's Betonbuch as a reference point, this paper also explores the challenges libraries, conservators and scientists face when collecting and caring for works on unusual materials, discussing issues in storing and preserving these materials, and illustrating broader challenges in collection care and stewardship. \n\nThis presentation was given as part of the Challenges in Caring for Art and Art Libraries: Preservation, Management, and Access panel.", 'identifiers': [{'scheme': 'hclegacy-pid', 'identifier': 'hc:45815'}, {'scheme': 'hclegacy-record-id', 'identifier': '1001634-295'}, {'scheme': 'datacite-doi', 'identifier': '10.17613/8mjh-e443'}, {'scheme': 'url', 'identifier': 'https://doi.org/10.17613/8mjh-e443'}], 'resource_type': {'id': 'presentation-other', 'title': {'de': 'sonstige Präsentationsmaterialien', 'en': 'Other presentation material'}, 'props': {'type': 'presentation', 'subtype': 'presentation-other'}, '@v': 'c774cca6-6467-4525-9893-122135271548::1'}, 'publication_date': '2022'}, 'custom_fields': {'hclegacy:file_pid': 'hc:45816', 'kcr:commons_domain': 'arlisna.hcommons.org', 'hclegacy:collection': 'hccollection:1', 'kcr:submitter_email': 'runmerd@gmail.com', 'hclegacy:submitter_id': '1018587', 'kcr:user_defined_tags': ['2022 ARLIS/NA Conference', 'Materials science', 'Conservation', 'Art librarianship', 'Special collections', "Artist's books"], 'hclegacy:file_location': '/srv/www/commons/current/web/app/uploads/humcore/2022/05/o_1g2q5lo5813ehdrr18ns3ol1dd97.pdf.wolf-vostells-betonbuch-materials-and-meanings-2022.pdf', 'kcr:submitter_username': 'mlhale7', 'hclegacy:record_change_date': '2022-05-11T18:25:57Z', 'hclegacy:previously_published': 'not-published', 'hclegacy:record_creation_date': '2022-05-11T18:25:57Z', 'hclegacy:submitter_org_memberships': ['arlisna', 'hc']}}

Nor is this a new conversation in librarianship. As early as 1971, Sanford Berman argued that LCSH were deeply intrenched in white, male, Eurocentric power structures in his text, Prejudices and Antipathies: A Track on the LC Subject Heads Concerning People. \n\nBut how does this apply to art researchers? How can art librarians with instruction responsibilities intercede so their patrons know they are dealing with a biased system? Especially if they only have a one-shot instruction session in which to do it? This presentation answers these questions by investigating how the Fine Arts (N) range privileges white, male, European art over art made by women and BIPOC peoples by favoring the "fine" arts  over the "craft" or "decorative" arts. Art historians have argued that the higher status traditionally given to "fine" arts in comparison to "craft" arts in the West, something clearly seen in LCC, is a consequence of patriarchal and white supremacist power systems. \n\nOnce this foundation has been laid, the presentation discusses a way to teach art history students about these inherent biases and power structures during one-shot information literacy instruction. This lesson, which can be scaled from 25-30 minutes, still leaves enough time to introduce students to the library resources they need to complete their research assignments.  Assessment of student learning and students\' reactions to the instruction is also discussed. \n\nPresented as part of Confronting the Myth of Neutrality: Addressing Bias and Inclusion in Cataloging and Classification in Art Libraries panel.', 'identifiers': [{'scheme': 'hclegacy-pid', 'identifier': 'hc:45869'}, {'scheme': 'hclegacy-record-id', 'identifier': '1001634-305'}, {'scheme': 'datacite-doi', 'identifier': '10.17613/4jdz-n252'}, {'scheme': 'url', 'identifier': 'https://doi.org/10.17613/4jdz-n252'}], 'resource_type': {'id': 'presentation-other', 'title': {'de': 'sonstige Präsentationsmaterialien', 'en': 'Other presentation material'}, 'props': {'type': 'presentation', 'subtype': 'presentation-other'}, '@v': 'c774cca6-6467-4525-9893-122135271548::1'}, 'publication_date': '2022', 'additional_titles': [{'type': {'id': 'other', 'title': {'de': 'Sonstiger Titel', 'en': 'Other'}, '@v': '76b2ec2b-e4fe-4815-9b61-96248806de8a::1'}, 'title': 'The Prejudices and Antipathies of Art: Teaching Students about Bias in the Library of Congress Fine Arts Classification During One-Shot Instruction'}]}, 'custom_fields': {'hclegacy:file_pid': 'hc:45870', 'kcr:commons_domain': 'arlisna.hcommons.org', 'hclegacy:collection': 'hccollection:1', 'kcr:submitter_email': 'hillessa@miamioh.edu', 'hclegacy:submitter_id': '1020580', 'kcr:user_defined_tags': ['Bias', 'Cataloging', 'library of congress', 'eurocentrism', '2022 ARLIS/NA Conference', 'Instruction', 'Race critical theory', 'Craft', 'Fine arts'], 'hclegacy:file_location': '/srv/www/commons/current/web/app/uploads/humcore/2022/05/o_1g2skrpcd1pds1j8p17uq1ils115n7.pdf.the-prejudices-and-antipathies-of-art.pdf', 'kcr:submitter_username': 'stefaniehilles', 'hclegacy:record_change_date': '2022-05-12T18:24:57Z', 'hclegacy:previously_published': 'not-published', 'hclegacy:record_creation_date': '2022-05-12T18:24:57Z', 'hclegacy:submitter_affiliation': 'Miami University', 'hclegacy:submitter_org_memberships': ['arlisna', 'hc']}}
